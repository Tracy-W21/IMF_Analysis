# IMF Data - GDP Insights
This project analyzes global GDP per capita for 2024 by leveraging web scraping, data cleaning, and visualization techniques. 
Using BeautifulSoup, I scraped GDP per capita data from the IMF Economic Data source, extracting figures for various countries. After cleaning and structuring the dataset with Pandas, I performed data analysis to calculate and highlight the countries with the highest and lowest GDP per capita, along with a ranked top 10 list from wealthiest to poorest. Finally, I used Matplotlib and Seaborn to create clear and insightful visualizations to present the findings. 
This project showcases my ability to collect, process, and interpret real-world economic data while building compelling visual narratives for data-driven insights.
